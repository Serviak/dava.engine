/**
	\ingroup baseobjects
	\brief	This class allow to create classes by name
 
	For example you want to create bunch of classes using their names it can be done easily using framework
	In implementation of your class you should write REGISTER_CLASS(ClassName) and this class now can 
	be created by it's name using ObjectFactory singleton
	
	Class must be inherited from BaseObject and have default constructor.
 
	Example:
	
	Definition of class
	\code
	// UIButton.h
	class UIButton : public BaseObject
	{
		UIButton::UIButton()
 
	};
	\endcode
	
	Implementation of class
	\code
	// UIButton.cpp
	
	REGISTER_CLASS(UIButton);
	
	UIButton::UIButton()
	{
	}
	\endcode
		
	Usage of ObjectFactory:
	\code
		
	void MyFunction()
	{
		UIButton * button = dynamic_cast<UIButton*>(ObjectFactory::Instance()->New("UIButton"));
		
	}
 
	\endcode
