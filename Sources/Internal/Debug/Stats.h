/**
    \brief Class to measure performance in framework code. 
 
    This class can help you to determine the bottlenecks of your code and measure the functions pefromance. 
 
    First step is initialization: 
    \code
    Scene::Scene()
    {
        Stats::Instance()->RegisterEvent("Scene", "Time spend in scene processing");
        Stats::Instance()->RegisterEvent("Scene.Update", "Time spend in draw function");
        Stats::Instance()->RegisterEvent("Scene.Draw", "Time spend in draw function");
    }
    \endcode
    
    Second step is measurement code: 
    \code
    void Scene::Update(float timeElapsed)
    {
        Stats::Instance()->BeginTimeMeasure("Scene.Update", this);
        // .. function code
        Stats::Instance()->EndTimeMeasure("Scene.Update", this);
    }
    
    void Scene::Draw()
    {
        Stats::Instance()->BeginTimeMeasure("Scene.Draw", this);
        // .. function code
        Stats::Instance()->EndTimeMeasure("Scene.Draw", this);
    }   
    \endcode
 
    Third step is initialization of output somewhere in your code: 
    \code
    void GameCore::OnAppStarted()
    {
        // show statistics every 30 frame, to avoid slowdown because of logger messages
        Stats::Instance()->EnableStatsOutputEventNFrame(30);
    }
 
    \endcode

        HashMap<FunctionMeasure *, FunctionMeasure *> children;
        FunctionMeasure * parent;
    };
