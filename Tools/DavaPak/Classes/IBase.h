/** \brief class to implement object reference counting
 *
 * This class is parent for some classes in our system 
 * Our conception is very simple but we have few
 * exeptions. 
 * For Example:
 * If you create texture with CreateTexture or LoadTexture
 * You must call method Release to release them, or 
 * just decrease reference counter.
 * But if you use Global namespace you must only check 
 * if specified System not NULL. (Never call Release for
 * Globals subsystems)
 * These subsystems are managed by Engine itself
 * Remember: all methods of IEngineSystem return 
 * Global systems.
